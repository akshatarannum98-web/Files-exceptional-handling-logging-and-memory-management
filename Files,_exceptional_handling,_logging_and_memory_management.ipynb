        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - The source code is executed line by line (or statement by statement) by an interpreter, without creating a separate machine code file first whereas the source code is translated entirely into machine code (binary) by a compiler before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python lets us catch and handle errors gracefully, so our program doesn’t crash.\n",

        "\n",
        "   try → Code that might cause an error\n",

        " - Logging in Python is a way to record (log) events that happen while a program is running. Instead of just printing messages with print(), we use the logging module to keep track of information, warnings, errors, and debugging details.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - __del__ is a special method in Python, also called a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected).\n",

        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import statement imports the entire module, we must use the module name as a prefix to access its functions, classes, or variabless whereas from ... import statement imports specific functions, classes, or variables from a module, we can use them directly without the module name.\n",

        " - We can handle multiple exceptions in Python using separate except blocks if you need different handling.\n",

        " - Use a tuple in one block if handling is the same.\n",

        " - Better than print() - print() is temporary and cluttered, while logging is structured and configurable.\n",

        " - Debugging and troubleshooting - Provides insights into what went wrong and when. Makes it easier to trace errors after the program has run.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Monitoring and auditing - Logs show how the program behaved over time. Useful for tracking user activity or system events.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently handling the allocation and deallocation of memory (RAM) for storing objects during program execution. Since Python is a high-level language, it automatically manages memory for the programmer, but it has specific mechanisms to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, exception handling is the process of responding to errors gracefully without crashing the program. It uses the try-except mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "try → risky code runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "except → handles errors if they occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "else → runs only if no error.\n",
        "\n",
        "finally → always runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management is important in Python because it ensures programs run efficiently, reliably, and without crashes. Since Python is often used for data-heavy applications (AI, ML, web apps), handling memory properly is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - try Block → Detect Errors. The try block contains the risky code (code that might raise an exception). If everything inside try runs without error → the except block is skipped. If an error occurs → Python immediately stops executing the try block and jumps to the except block. Whereas except Block → Handle Errors. The except block defines how to respond when an error happens. It prevents the program from crashing by catching exceptions and providing alternative actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python’s garbage collection (GC) system is what keeps memory usage efficient by automatically cleaning up objects that are no longer needed. It ensures that unused memory is reclaimed, so programs don’t run out of memory or suffer from leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The Purpose of the else block to write code that should only run if no exception occurs in the try block. It helps separate the \"successful execution\" logic from the \"error handling\" logic, making the program cleaner.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, the logging module provides different logging levels to indicate the severity or importance of a message. These levels help developers filter logs and control how much information gets recorded.\n",
